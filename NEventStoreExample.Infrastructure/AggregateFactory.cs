  // to create a valid instance of that object (eg, Person needs a twitter handle to be valid if I were doing twitter stream analysis)
  // Internally, to EventStore, I want it to be able to create my object via a private ctor and I'm going to pass in the
  // objects id.
  // This method is pretty simplistic but my current domain suits it just fine.
